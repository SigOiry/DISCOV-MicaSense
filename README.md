This repository complements a scientific paper published by Oiry et
al. in Remote Sensing of Environment (Under review).

This paper has produced during Simon Oiry’s PhD and the [BiCOME
project](https://bicome.info). The project is one of three studies that
form part of the European Space Agency’s ‘Biodiversity+ Precursors’
on [Terrestrial
(EO4DIVERSITY)](https://www.eo4diversity.info/), [Freshwater
(BIOMONDO)](https://www.biomondo.info/) and Coastal ecosystems (BiCOME).

This work demonstrates the development and application of a Neural
Network classification model trained on a Micasense RedEdge-MX Dual
multispectral drone camera. This model is called **DISCOV**, which
stands for **D**rone **I**ntertidal **S**ubstrats **C**lassification
**O**f **V**egetation.
